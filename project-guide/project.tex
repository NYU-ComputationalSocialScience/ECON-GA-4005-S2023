\section*{Overview}

One key outcome of this course is for you to produce a piece of work you can use
to demonstrate your computational skills to potential employers and to potential
students of this  class in future years (this is your audience -- keep this in
mind!). That work will come in the form of a Jupyter notebook. As you know,
these notebooks allow you to combine code, text, and graphics in one
user-friendly document. We will add them to our GitHub repository (with your
permission) so that you can use a link to show others what you've done. You will
also be able to see what your classmates have done.

The relatively loose structure in self-directed projects like this makes them
more challenging than most things you do in school. We think that also makes
them more interesting. They give you a chance to indulge your curiosity and show
off your creativity.

We have divided the project into components to keep you on track. The intent is
to make the project easier by breaking it down into a number of small,
manageable sub-projects. The early steps are graded only on whether you do them:
you get full points if you do them, none if you don't. We start with individual
work.  Partway along, we encourage you to form groups of two or three, but if
you'd prefer to do this on your own, that's ok, too.

            \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf Dates are firm and not open for negotiation.}

Each part of the project must be uploaded to Brightspace before the deadline.


The components consist of:
\begin{itemize}

      \item {\bf Three project ideas.}

            Write down three project ideas. One or two sentences each is enough.
            Use your imagination.  Be creative.  Speak to others. Write down
            things that interest you. This will not be graded, but it will give
            you something to work with later on.

            Over the coming weeks, we recommend you keep your ears open for
            possible {\bf project ideas} --- and {\bf data sources\/}.

            \item{\bf Project proposal.}

            Form a group of between one and three --- no more --- and choose a
            single project from those you submitted --- or perhaps some other idea
            if you get a sudden flash of inspiration. Flesh out the project in more
            detail, {\bf including the data source, ideas for a model\/} and two
            figures you plan to produce. Total length should be no more than
            two pages.

            On the off-chance you missed the point:  you should {\bf be clear
                        about the data and type of model you plan to use\/}. If
            you can't get the data, your whole project can be
            derailed.

                  {\bf Did we mention data? Or models?}

      \item {\bf Data and Model report.}

            Describe your data and how you accessed it in enough detail that someone else
            could do it. Yes, that's ``accessed,'' past tense.  You should have done this
            already to make sure you have it. Include your Python code.

            Internet sources are preferred, because it allows others to use your code and
            follow up on your work.

            Also include notes about the type of model you plan to fit. You to
            not necessarily need to have fit the model at this stage, but you
            should show us what you are thinking. Now that you have the data,
            being explicit and clear (through writing) about how you plan to use
            the data is extremely helpful in spotting potential roadblocks and
            making sure you have a coherent plan.

      \item {\bf Final project.}

            You should submit your {\bf notebook\/} to Brightspace by the due date
            listed above. The submission should include any data or supplementary files
            needed to execute your project. The final writeup should be a Jupyter
            notebook and the file name should be your last names separated by dashes and
            a short title --- something like {\tt Jones-Smith-Zhang.ipynb}.

            Your project should include:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Description cell.  Put a Markdown cell at the top of your notebook that
                        includes the title of your project, a list of authors, and a short summary of
                        what you do.  Think of the last one as an advertisement to potential readers.
                  \item Data.  Description of data sources and the code to read the data into
                        Python and reformat it as needed. This should be done in enough detail that
                        someone else can reproduce what you've done.
                  \item Model.  Description of the model(s) used to analyze the data and
                        the code to fit the model. This should be done in enough detail
                        that someone else can reproduce what you've done.
                  \item Graphics.  A series of figures that tell us something interesting. Three
                        or four would be enough, but do what you think works best for your project.
                        Think about the narrative:  What story do you want to tell?
                  \item Conclusion. What was the main outcome or result of your project?
                        What did you learn? What should readers take away? Were you surprised
                        by anything? Is there futher work you or someone else could to do
                        extend your analysis?
            \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\section*{Free advice}

Some things to keep in mind:
%
\begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Keep it simple.}

            Most project ideas turn out to be too big.  You're generally well-advised to
            carve out a manageable subset of what you think you can do. There's no reason to
            worry about this at the idea generation stage, but as you develop your project
            you may find that you need to focus more narrowly on a part of it.

      \item {\bf Find data.}  Make sure you can get the data you need. One way to
            assure this is to start with data and ask what you can do with it. Ideally you
            want the intersection (picture a Venn diagram) of an interesting idea and good
            data.  You can start with either one, but ideas are often easier to find than
            data. Or start with an existing project that uses data you can access yourself
            and extend it in some way.


      \item {\bf Ask for help.}
            We have years of experience with this kind of thing. If you're stuck, let us
            know and we'll try to help. You can also post questions on the class discussion
            board.

\end{itemize}


\section*{Grading}

Projects will be graded on their overall quality.  This includes, but is not
restricted to, these categories:
%
\begin{itemize}
      \item Quality of the idea ($\sim 10$ points).  Is the question clearly
            articulated?  Is it interesting? Does it have general appeal?
      \item Quality of the data ($\sim 10$ points).  Does the data support the
            idea? Is it the best data for this question?
      \item Quality of the model ($\sim 20$ points).  Did you choose an
            appropriate model for your data and question? Where you able to fit
            the model effectively?
      \item Degree of difficulty ($\sim 10$ points).  Some ideas are harder than
            others to implement. As in Olympic diving, you get credit for taking
            on a challenge.
      \item Professional look ($\sim 20$ points).  Does your project look
            professional?  Are the graphs easy to understand?  Are they clearly
            labeled? Is there any unneccesary code output that could be hidden
            or cleaned up? Would you feel comfortable attaching this to a resume
            when looking for a job?
      \item Demonstration of skills ($\sim 20$ points). Does your project
            showcase what you've learned in this class? Do you use some of the
            theory or algorithms we've worked on? How does your application of
            these tools impact your final writeup?
      \item Professional writing ($\sim 10$ points). Your audience is students
            in future years who may consider taking this class. Make sure you
            explain each part of your analysis including what you are doing, why
            you are doing it in that way, what the outcomes are, and what the
            outcomes mean.
